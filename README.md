# FLOWERS-PREDICTION-USING-KNN-K-NEAREST-NEIGHBOR-
This repository contains a Machine Learning project that uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species based on their measurements.

This project predicts the species of Iris flowers 🌺 using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm**. The model is trained on the classic Iris Dataset.target_names('setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica').

The model is trained and tested using Scaler.

```
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler,MinMaxScaler
```

Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report shows high prediction accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of KNN.
